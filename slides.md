## What is Design By Example?
- A development process

## Why Design By Example?
- Encourages simple design

- Design By Example is not about testing
  - the goal is to drive the design through the actual usage
  - tests are just a tool to achieve the goal
  - tests are a by-product of the process

## Challenges
- Breaking the existing habits:
   - the urge to write production code without tests
   - the urge not the clean the code after it starts to work
- Learning to use development tools efficiently: 
  - a good knowledge of Visual Studio / Resharper
